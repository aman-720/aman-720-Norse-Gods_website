		Before the beginning of time, there was Ginnungagap – a bottomless abyss, which separated the icy land of Niflheim and the fiery land of Muspelheim. These two realms rose in power and clashed; the burning frost turned into water drops and the water drops turned into life.

The first living being was Ymir, a hermaphroditic giant who was created from those life-giving drops of water and whose death was brought about by Odin and his brothers. Odin, Vili, and Vé, Ymir’s descendants, fashioned the Nordic mythological universe from his blood, bones, flesh, teeth, hair, eyelashes, brains and skull.

The Norse gods belong to two major clans: Æsir and Vanir. Odin, Frigg, Thor, Loki, Balder, Hod, Heimdall and Tyr are the most elevated representatives of Æsir and are known as the main gods. The second clan, Vanir, contains the fertility gods and count Njord, Freyr, and Freyja as their most notable members. Despite the antagonism between them, it was necessary for the two families to combine their powers and ideals for all to prosper.</p>

Stemming from the northern Germanic tradition, the mythology of the Norse is by design both grim and grand. It is the mythology not just of a people with a strong warrior culture, but of a people who found great joy in art and in crafts. It is a mythology of people who explored, who survived on the edges of the world and ultimately of those who believed that everything in the world was predestined to end and begin again.

The gods of the Norse were not a single people. Instead, they were Aesir and Vanir, giants and dwarves and more. There were monsters to be sure, but there were also gods who were remarkably human. Some of these gods behaved as humans did, having adventures and getting into petty quarrels. Other gods sat high about the fray, responsible for vast domains that were outside of mortal reckoning.

One of the most unusual things about the Norse gods was that they could die. Though they could be granted youth and health through the consumption of special foods, the gods can and would die. They could fall in battle or fall prey to horrifying tricks, but they could be brought to a permanent end. These gods were remarkably like people if perhaps those who were possessed by great abilities.

Like the gods of many other pantheons, the Norse gods had domains. Their domains were roughly divided by gender – the male deities like Odin or Thor would be responsible for battle or death or thunder, while the female deities might have responsibilities for fertility or crops. They corresponded in many ways with other Germanic gods, but still managed to fit within the unique bounds of Norse society.

There is also a certain sense of destiny that surrounds all of the Norse gods. Unlike the gods of other pantheons, there is no sense that they are eternal. Even the greatest of the gods would play a role in the final battle, the Ragnarok, and they would fall. The actions of each would play a role in ushering at that end of days, one in which the gods would finally fall as they fought their various enemies and only a pair of humans would be left on an empty Earth.

Though the Norse sagas could seem grim to some, there is also an element of hope in all of them. While the death of the gods might be pre-ordained, there was always the caveat that the world would begin anew. It made sense for the Norse, who dealt with seasonal shifts in weather and crop availability, to see the world as one that existed in cycles. It would only follow, then, that their gods would be beholden to those same cycles.
		

<h1> Odin...AllFather</h1>

	<p> ODIN

		<img  style="float: left;" src="jia-yi-su-20160809-odin.jpg" alt="Odin" title="Odin"  height="499" width="360"> 
		Odin is the Norse king of the Aesir, the principal race of Norse gods. He was considered the father of all the gods and was primarily associated with magic, wisdom, war, poetry, and the runic alphabet.
<br><br>
Mentioned frequently from the period of the Roman occupation to the Viking Age, Odin is a prominent figure in Norse mythology who continues to be acknowledged in modern popular culture. For instance, we are reminded of him every Wednesday, the weekday that was named after him; Odin is Woden in Old English, and Woden’s day became Wednesday.

<h3>Appearance</h3>



In most Norse texts, Odin is depicted as a long-bearded, one-eyed man wearing a broad hat and a cloak. Odin lost his eye upon visiting a Norse god named Mimir. Mimir was known as an extremely wise god, and he had also possessed a well called Mímisbrunnr.<br> The waters in the well contained substantial wisdom and knowledge, and if someone drank from the well they would also gain wisdom.
<br><br>
However, Mimir required the drinker to sacrifice one of their eyes in order to take a drink. Odin decided to make the trade. Because of this trade, he is traditionally shown as having a dark eye or with a patch over one of his eyes.

<h3>Family</h3>
Odin had two brothers, named Vili and Ve. Myth has it that Odin created the universe after killing the primal frost giant Ymir with the help of his brothers. The three continued by making the first man and woman, Askr and Embla, from an ash tree and an elm tree.
<br><br>
Odin married Frigg, who is the mother of his sons Baldur, Hod, and Hermod.  With Jord, the earth goddess, he fathered Thor. He is believed to have had more sons by other wives, including Vidar from the giantess Grid.
<br>
<br>
Odin is the son of Borr and the jötunn Bestla. He is married to the goddess Frigg, by whom he is the father of the twin gods Baldr and Höðr. With the giantesses Gríðr and Rindr, Odin has two other sons named Víðarr and Váli. His eldest son is Thor, god of thunder, born to him by Jörð, the personification of the Earth.

<h3>Symbols</h3>
<img src="valknut-300x257.png"width="249" height="200" style="vertical-align:text-top; float: left;" cine="Valknut Symbol" alt="Valknut Symbol" title="Valknut Symbol">
The most common symbol associated with Odin is the Valknut symbol, which is made of three linked or interlocked triangles. This symbol appears in a number of places along with Odin or ravens, including the Tängelgårda stone in Sweden.
<br><br>

There are a number of interpretations about the meaning of the Valknut. Some believe it represented slain warriors, many of which went to stay with Odin in Valhalla. In fact, the word Valknut is derived from the words valr, which means slain warriors, and knut, which means knot. Others think that it may symbolize the heart of Hrungnir.
<br><br>







Another common symbol affiliated with Odin is his spear, called Gungnir, which he acquired from the trickster god Loki after he stole it from the dwarfs who made it.

The ravens Hugin (thought) and Munin (memory) were Odin’s companions. They traveled across the Nine Worlds in Norse cosmology and returned to their master’s shoulder with tales of what they saw.
<br><br>
Odin also had two pet wolves called Geri and Freki. He is said to have created them when he became lonely. Like ravens, they haunt battlefields and feast upon the dead. Odin, who only drinks wine, gave them all his food.

<h3>Powers & Duties</h3>
In Valhalla, Odin sat on his throne called Hlidskjalf from where he watched over the Nine Realms.
<br><br>
Odin sought further knowledge in the runes, the letters of the runic alphabet. To achieve this, he hung from a tree with a spear in his side for nine days and nights without food or drink. He often used runes to practice wizardry.
<br><br>
Together with Freya, the goddess of love and war, Odin possessed the souls of slain warriors. The half that belonged to him found a final resting place in Valhalla, his palatial home with 640 doors. They were brought here by Odin’s daughters, the Valkyries, who met them on the battlefield.
<br><br>
Odin had a never-ending quest for wisdom. Sometime after he sacrificed his eye, he also took possession of Mimir’s head when Mimir was decapitated by the Vanir, a rival tribe. The head would tell him secrets and give him advice.<br><br><br><br>

<h3>About Odin</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Odin rode on a flying, eight-legged steel horse called Sleipnir</li>
	<li>As a god of war, Odin often meddled in the affairs of humans to incite violence. Myth has it that he could cause battles simply by throwing his spear</li>
	<li>The Vikings, especially the champion berserker warriors, sacrificed humans in Odin’s honor. As the one who decided who won battles, he was their patron;</li>
	<li>Odin meets his demise in the form of Fenrir, a giant wolf and son of Loki, who kills and eats him during Ragnarök, the end of the world in Norse mythology;</li>
	<li>Odin is often described as the king of gods, favored by princes, nobles, and warriors;</li>
	<li>The books of the Prose Edda, an Old Norse work of literature, frequently attests to Odin. His relationship with other figures, such as Freya, Loki, and Frigg, has also been the subject of many Germanic studies;</li>
	<li>Writer J.R.R. Tolkien based several of his characters on Odin. The wizard Gandalf looks a lot like Odin in his cloaked and hooded disguise;</li>
